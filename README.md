#### Demo acquisitions module exposing some acquisitions apis and objects based on the raml-module-builder framework against a MongoDB

This project is built using the raml-module-builder, using the MongoDB async client to implement some basic acquisition APIs. The project also includes a small demo of the drools functionality. It is highly recommended to read the [raml-module-builder README](https://github.com/folio-org/raml-module-builder/blob/master/README.md)

APIs Implemented:

    Funds CRUD
    Invoices CRUD
    PO_lines CRUD

Objects / Schemas:

    Funds
    Invoices
    Invoice Lines
    Purchase Order Lines
    Vendor

Can be run in both embedded mongodb mode or with a regular MongoDB server.

### Instructions

clone / download the raml-module-builder and `mvn clean install`

then do the same for the current project `mvn clean install`

Run:

java -jar acquisitions-fat.jar -Dhttp.port=8083 embed_mongo=true


Or via Dockerfile

Note that the embedded mongo is started on a dynamic port chosen at embedded mongo start up - refer to the log ("created embedded mongo config on port 54851")

### Documentation of the Service's APIs

Documentation is auto-generated from the RAML file into HTML.
After the service is started, the documentation can be viewed at:

http://localhost:8083/apidocs/index.html?raml=raml/acquisitions/acquisitions.raml

#### Querying examples

```sh
Make sure to include appropriate headers, as the runtime framework validates them.

Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

simple query:

http://localhost:8083/invoices

query with a filter (mongo syntax):

http://localhost:8083/invoices?query={"$and": [ { "total_amount": { "$lt": 111 } }, { "vendor_contact_person.first_name": "joe" } ]}
```


#### Post example:

```sh

http://localhost:8083/invoices

Make sure to include appropriate headers, as the runtime framework validates them.
